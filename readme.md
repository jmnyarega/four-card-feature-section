## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

 - I wanted to align the image on the card to the left, it worked fine using `float: right`, but on mobile screen
   it was getting out of the card. I think this can be solved by using float resets.
